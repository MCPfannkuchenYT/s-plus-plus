This Project is a small program that modifies the output of my User Profile from here: `https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=MCPfannkuchenYT&theme=tokyonight`
to be much more repectable wait what.

The reason why I did this, is because the entire website doesn't make any sense. Check this A+ Rank out: https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=cityscraper&theme=tokyonight.
Yep, A+ with a single contribution back in 2014, this is not what this was ment to do was it :thinking:.

Please don't use this to cheat on a serious profile without mentioning it somewhere.
